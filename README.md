# neko-chan-telebot

Updated version of (skitt_bot)[https://github.com/skittles9823/skitt_bot] with some features (filters, basically) from (SkittBot)[https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot] to work with latest version of python-telegram-bot

## Note

For the first 70 commits or so, I didn't know that the concept of co-authorship existed.... so while the base logic is the same as the above mentioned repositories with some changes that I thought were needed, the commit authorship for those is shown as mine. Now there's a lot of stuff withing those 70 commits that actually are my own idea (like the `exceptions` and `nhentai` modules, as well as the sql schemas for everything) and it would honestly be a pain to go through all 70 commits and figure out which to amend and change authorship of to add co-authorship to (Rhyse Simpson)[https://github.com/skittles9823]...

I got to talk to him on telegram and he said it was kinda OK to let the current history be and I can add him as co-author on all future commits where I'm taking his code and either just updating it to work with latest version of `python-telegram-bot` or editing it as I see fit. So please don't flame me too much for essentially kanging those entire projects :P This bot was kinda meant more for me to have everything I want in a single place and on the way somehow became about wanting to kick @NotAMemeBot from a group I'm on (yeah, I'm kinda irrational that way)
